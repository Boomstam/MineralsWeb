Warnings:
- Turn of local client or local server for build.
- For some reason the windows/editor builds only connect after webgl is connected
- Clear the WebGL build folder for a clean build

So => 
- Set to Dedicated Server/Linux. Press build 3/4 times via minerals menu to go through build process.
- When server is launching, switch to webgl. Press build 2/3 times via minerals menu to go through build process.
- When webgl is building, open playflow logs and itchio editor
- When webgl build is ready, switch to standalone/Windows
- When switching, zip webgl folders and upload to itchio
- When uploading, press build via minerals menu 1/2 times to setup Windows build
- Do build via build settings menu

Now run the webgl build when the server is up, and then the others should also connect.
